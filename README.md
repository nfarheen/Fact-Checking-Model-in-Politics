# Fact-Checking-Model-in-Politics
PolitiFact is a fact-checking website that rates the accuracy of claims by elected officials and others who speak up in American politics.
My aim is to build a Machine learning model that can detect if a quote said by a politician is True or False. In doing so, this model 
can be used to fact check quotes told by politicians in real time.

## File Description - Python

- Web_Scraping_Politifact.py: Web scraping script to get data from Politifact website.
- Politifact.csv: The csv file obtained after web scraping.
- Model_Text.py: Machine learning models built only on the quotes.
- Model_Text_Source.py: Machine learning models built on the quotes and the person who said it. 
     (*For Example: "Donald Trump, I was against the war in Iraq"*)
- Politifact.ipynb: The entire analysis done on Ipython Notebook.
- Politifact.pptx: Presentation file.
